This is a compact Sudoku solver implemented in Ruby. Typical calling procedure
is something like:

  puzzle = [[0, 0, 1, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3],
            [9, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 1, 6, 0],
            [0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 7],
            [0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9],
            [0, 0, 4, 3, 0, 2, 6, 0, 0],
            [2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0],
            [6, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0],
            [0, 4, 2, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 6],
            [5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 8, 0, 0]]
  
  solved = Sudoku.solve(puzzle)

  # [[7, 6, 1, 9, 2, 8, 4, 5, 3],
  #  [9, 2, 5, 7, 4, 3, 1, 6, 8],
  #  [4, 3, 8, 6, 1, 5, 9, 2, 7],
  #  [3, 5, 7, 4, 6, 1, 2, 8, 9],
  #  [8, 9, 4, 3, 7, 2, 6, 1, 5],
  #  [2, 1, 6, 5, 8, 9, 3, 7, 4],
  #  [6, 8, 9, 1, 5, 4, 7, 3, 2],
  #  [1, 4, 2, 8, 3, 7, 5, 9, 6],
  #  [5, 7, 3, 2, 9, 6, 8, 4, 1]
